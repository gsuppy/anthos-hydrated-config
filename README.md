# Anthos Demo

Anthos is a product designed to enable companies to modernize their existing systems, automate security policies, and provide consistent experiences regardless of where their workloads run.

In this session you’ll work through an example modernization effort moving a hybrid workload from a cluster that could be on-prem or with another cloud vendor to Google Kubernetes Engine. During the course of this exercise you’ll learn more about the features available in Anthos and GKE including. 

Topics covered will include:

GKE Connect & GKE Hub 
- Register non-GKE k8s to hub
- Deploy workloads - Hybrid hipster 
- Review GKE & non GKE clusters and workloads through hub

Config Manager 
- Show base state which auto installs namespaces & logging daemonset on all nodes
- Register non-GKE cluster with Config manager and see the config apply
- Add a new config, push to repo and watch it apply to both clusters
